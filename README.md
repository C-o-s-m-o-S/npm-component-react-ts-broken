# TypeScript Components (Broken)

This repository was created as part of a guide to publishing TypeScript React components.

## Getting Started

Install this package:

```shell
npm add npm-component-react-ts
```

Import the Counter component:

```js
import { Counter } from "npm-component-react-ts";
```

You can then render the `Counter` component like any other React component in JSX.


## Publish to NPM

```shell
npm login
cd dist
npm publish
```
